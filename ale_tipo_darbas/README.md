This is my second sprint project.
The basic idea is to be able to see all of your files in folders and navigate around them.

Things you should know: 
1. UN ALIVE means DELETE. *you will see this near files you might want to delete.*
2. To download files you need to click on the file name. *this only works for files not folders.*
3. I made the root folder 'Random' instead of the main folder to avoid accidently deleting the code. Do not rename the 'Random' folder.
4. For this program to work you need XAMPP and to enable 'Apache'.
5. The home page should be http://localhost/"program folder name here".
6. the login email is 'test@mail.com' and the password is 'password'

How to run.
First download the github files. *you can do this by downloading and extracting the zip, cloning with github desktop or getting it on your system with gitbash*<br>
Your files will need to be in the XAMPP htdocs folder to function properly.<br>
Once your files are in the XAMPP htdocs folder open up XAMPP and start the Apache server.<br>
After that is done you should be set and ready to go!<br><br>

Happy bug searching!
